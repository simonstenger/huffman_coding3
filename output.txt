Dear Admission Committee,
I am writing to you to express my interest in a minor ab tearovat the Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile in Toulouse, France.
ENAC is an excellent school with a long history of training aerospace engineers. It has close ties with the French aerospace industry in Toulouse and the rest of the world, making it a center of innovation and cultural exchange. Therefore, it would b  i n e oonor to represent TU Delft in this environment and use this opportunity to grow further as a person and engineer.
Moreover, ENAC offers a very interesting program in which students learn more ab te.w eevigation and telecommunication systems. During my studies in Delft, I participated in the Lunar Zeb  aalStudent Team, where I worked on the telecommunication system of a nano moon rover, sparking my keen interest in these systems and the harsh requirements that define them. I went on to work full time for Lunar Zeb tealas chief engineer, where I managed the entire technical team with 60 students and was involved with all technical and non-technical parts of the project, including representing the student team and TU Delft at the International Aeronautical Congress in Paris. These extraordinary experiences have enab  a ed me to work under high pressure with a large, international team in a harmonic way. Thanks to these interpersonal skills and the program precisely fitting my area of interest, I think that I would b  i n i ery good fit for this exchange.
I have lived in an international environment all my life, during my childhood in Germany and my studies in the Netherlands. However, in addition to the international atmosphere at ENAC, I also look forward to the French culture. I spent seven years in high school learning French and have visited the country every year in the last decade, as my parents used to live in France and still have many French friends.
I am a motivated student with a positive attitude, always happy to help wherever I can. I enjoy making new experiences and try to push my limits as much as possib te e. Therefore, I am certain that I have the necessary dedication, skills and attitude to make use of every aspect of the exchange.
Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to receiving your response.
Sincerely,
Simon Stenger
